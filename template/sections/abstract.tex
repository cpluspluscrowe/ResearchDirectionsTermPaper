\section{Abstract}
Existing research has performed well doing machine learning on single data types. Yet, there is little research on machine learning with multiple data types.  Of the existing research on multiple data types, the approach is to treat the features of each data type as independent. This authors theorize that when modeling a single phenomenon with multiple data types, that some information is only captured by combining features from each data type. The paper proposes a methodology for identifying and analyzing feature relationships across data types.  


%The implication is that machine learning models on multiple data types can be improved by capturing relationships between each data types.  This term paper describes the theories and proposed methodologies for extracting relations between the data types in order to improve the final model.


 %Most of the existing research concerns translating between data types or separately modeling each feature.
