\section{What area within IT would you like to draw upon to inform a topic that you are interested in?}

The area of interest within IT with applied machine learning is the topic of multi-models.  Multi-models is how current research has denoted learning of features from different data types.  They have been referred to as multi-models, because their use is in the context of multiple models.  Those multiple models are one model for each data type and a third model that mixes each data type. There are only a few papers on building multi-models, most of these concern decomposing videos into audio and images.  Such an example is predicting words by videotaping a mouth.  One model is trained on mouth movement, another is trained on audio, and a mixed model tries to discover a relationship between mouth moving and speech.
