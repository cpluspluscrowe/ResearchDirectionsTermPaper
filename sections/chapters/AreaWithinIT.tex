\chapter{Area within IT}

The area of interest within IT is applied machine learning on multi-data type datasets.  Applied machine learning is a popular field within IT and operates on many datasets.  One type of dataset within the field is multi-data type datasets.  These are datasets whose input data have multiple types, e.g. a dataset that contains both image and text data.  An example of such a dataset might be X-Ray data and a list of patient symptoms.  The mix of multiple data types makes the problem more complex.  Also, these datasets are important, but have received less attention by researchers, partly due to their complexity.  There are opportunities for new methods and theories for analyzing mutli-data type datasets.  This makes the area within IT an interesting field for new research.
