\chapter{Topic within IT}

The area of interest within IT and applied machine learning is the topic of multi-data type datasets.  These are datasets which consist of more than one data type, such as a dataset containing both text and image data.  These datasets are interesting because another data type adds complexity to the problem.  It is also a field that has received less attention in research.  There are opportunities for new methods and better ways to approach and analyze multi-data type datasets.
