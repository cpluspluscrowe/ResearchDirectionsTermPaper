\subsection{Contributing to a Body of Knowledge within IT}

One of the researchers in this paper works within advertising.  Most of the datasets in this field comprise multiple data types.  Examples are posts, which can contain images, video, text, and other metadata.  While this is the general field of interest, the proposed research question is very generic and should apply to many contexts.  The body of knowledge within IT is multi-faceted.  One facet is the analysis of multi-type datasets.  Another facet is the use of boosting techniques for DNNs.  A third facet is the combined CNN architecture proposed for processing text and image data.  The use of boosting in DNNs and a proposed architecture for new datasets can contribute to current research within applied machine learning.
