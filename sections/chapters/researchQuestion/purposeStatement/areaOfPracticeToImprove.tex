\subsection{Is there an area of practice you would like to improve?}

In searching for dataset on multi-data type models that are comprised on image and text data on Kaggle, most of the datasets were within medicine.  Examples include X-Rays, CT Scans, MRIs, as well as a set of symptoms or relevant data about the scan or patient.  Processing medical images is a well studied field within machine learning.  This paper hopes to improve the field of medical image processing by providing researcher's with a methodology for combining current medical imaging practice with other complicated text or numerical data.

The paper's main contributer is a software engineer at LinkedIn on their advertisement reporting team.  The LinkedIn advertising team is responsible for the real-time reporting of advertising events that occur on LinkedIn.  Anytime an advertisement is seen or interacted with, our team collects those events and reports them to advertisers.  A benefit of being on this team is being involved in the process of creating new advertising platforms and analyzing the performance of advertising campaigns.  The involvement with advertising gives the authors particular interest at analyzing advertiser content.  The advertising team deal with many types of advertising data, like user reactions, images, and comments. This provides interest in these advertising metrics, whose inputs are diverse types of data, e.g. text, image, and video data.
