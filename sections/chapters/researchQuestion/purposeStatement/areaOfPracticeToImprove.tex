\subsection{Is there an area of practice you would like to improve?}

I work as a software engineer at LinkedIn on their advertisement reporting team.  Our team is responsible for the real-time reporting of advertising events that occur on LinkedIn.  Anytime an advertisement is seen or interacted with, our team collects those events and reports them to advertisers.  A benefit of being on this team is that we are often involved in the process of creating new advertising platforms and analyzing the performance of advertising campaigns.  Currently, I am the leading developer for an advertising strategy where advertisers can target the decision makers at companys who buy their products.  Due to my involvement with advertising and analyzing campaign performance, I have particular interest at analyzing advertiser content.  Since our team reports advertising content, we often deal with all the types of advertisements and their metrics, e.g. percentage of video watched by a LinkedIn member, clicks, impressions, and if they click on advertisements or later visit particular webpages via cookies setup by advertisers on LinkedIn.  This gives me particular interest in these advertising metrics, whose inputs are diverse types of data, e.g. text, image, and video data.
