\subsection{Social Reality}

The overarching theory behind the research question proposes that when multiple data types describe a phenomenon, that those data types are related. The theory is that some of the data from each data type is correlated, since the data is extracted from the same event.  %Need to talk aobut feature space
For example, social media advertisement contains an image and a description.  The user's reaction to an advertisement is likely a factor of not only the image or the description, but a factor of both the image and its description.  The theory poses that when data naturally occur together, each type of data contains correlations with the other type of data.

Another theory is that the correlations between data types can be discovered and measured. The theory supporting the research question proposes that these correlations can be measured within machine learning models.

The research question also assumes that new machine learning architectures can better learn when designed to take advantage of correlations that may exist between the different data types.  These different architectures can either add data to existing models or improve upon existing models that usually only operate on one type of data.  By considering how each data type might interact, and how the model can learn from this interaction, the model may be able to better learn and represent the data and its features.
