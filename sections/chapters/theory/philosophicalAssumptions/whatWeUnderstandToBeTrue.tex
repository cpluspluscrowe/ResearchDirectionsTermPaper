\subsection{What we understand to be true}

Some of the required theories are generally accepted. It is known when multiple data types exist, machine learning models can learn by including both data types in its models.  The difference is that usually these data types are separately modeled or each data type is transformed into a set of features which may be combined.  

Current theories have also shown that different data types can be analyzed with the same architecture.  For example, a CNN can perform image analysis and NLP tasks.  Yet, CNNs will perform worse on and differently on NN than on CNNs.  Also, a NN can process text and image data, but NN poorly draw out image features.  Existing studies have also transcribed one data type to another, such as sentence descriptions of images.  Yet, sentence description is generally the goal, not a transformation of data for more analysis.
