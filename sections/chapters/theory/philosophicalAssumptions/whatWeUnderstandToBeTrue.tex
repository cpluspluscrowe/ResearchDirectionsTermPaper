\subsection{What we understand to be true}

Some of the required theories are generally accepted. It is known when multiple data types exist, machine learning models can learn by including both data types in its models.  This can be seen in ensemble models.  It is also well accepted that model performance can be improved by weaker models, which are trained via boosting.

Current theories have also shown that different data types can be analyzed with the same architecture.  For example, a CNN can perform image analysis and NLP tasks.  Yet, CNNs will perform worse and differently on NNs than on CNNs.  Also, a NN can process text and image data, but NN poorly draw out image features.  Existing studies have also transcribed one data type to another, such as sentence descriptions of images.
