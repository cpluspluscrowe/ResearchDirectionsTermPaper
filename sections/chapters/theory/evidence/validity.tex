\subsection{Validity}

By running the machine learning model on existing machine learning datasets, its results can be contrasted against existing research.  The model's performance on the test and validation dataset validates the model's performance.  Including multiple benchmarks datasets and reporting their performance on the test and validation dataset provide other researchers with confirmation that the research techniques are valid and performant.
