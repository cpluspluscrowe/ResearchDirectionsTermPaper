\subsubsection{Rigor}

Scientific rigor is the strict application of scientific methods to ensure robust and unbiased experimental design, methodology, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results (NIH Grant Application).  The robust and unbiased results is ensured by applying machine learning models to existing benchmarks and testing the model's result.  Machine learning benchmarks even come equipped with verification datasets to ensure unbiased experimental results.  The application of machine learning models on test data is a common machine learning research methodology.  The performance of the model on the verification dataset can be reported.  The model architecture and its trained keras file can be uploaded on GitHub for fellow researchers to reproduce the findings and use the model.
