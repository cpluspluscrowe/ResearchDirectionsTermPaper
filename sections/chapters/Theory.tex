\chapter{Theory} % What we understand

Theory speaks to which accepted theories the topic relies on.  One such assumption is that having more knowledge about a dataset will create machine learning models which perform better on the same data.  The goal of extracting knowledge from a dataset for a machine learning model is often known as feature extraction.  Practitioners who perform better feature extraction create models that perform better.  This feature extraction consists of extracting information from the model.  Another aspect is the quality of those features, i.e. do the features predict data behavior.  The proposition of this paper is more knowledge, i.e. features can be extracted when considering text and image datasets together, rather than each separately.  These joint features provide new knowledge, therefore new features, which should result in knowledge gained and a potentially better performing final machine learning model.  

Another theory is that data types are not always mutually exclusive in their features, i.e. that correlations can exist between features in different data types.  This theory has been shown to be true in videos by decomposing data into visual and audio data.  Yet, this theory has less support between text and image datasets.  This research provides opportunity to affirm or prove false for datasets consisting of text and image data.
