\subsection{What would you like to know?}

The research goal is to verify that features between different data types exist, and these data types and their interracting features can be empirically detected so that the amount of knowledge the model knows is increased, which in turn will increase overall model accuracy.  

%The reserach goal is to capture interplaying features between text and image data.  Moreover, the research wants to investigate architectures that are best for handling compound inputs that comprise text and image data.  The research will also explore transformations that will aid in the overall analysis of both data types.
