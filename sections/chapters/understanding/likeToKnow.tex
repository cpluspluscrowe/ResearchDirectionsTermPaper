\subsection{What would you like to know?}

There is a need to verify that joint features in multi-type datasets exist. The ability to detect these features can encourage researchers to make note that such features exist and should be included in their analysis.  Finally, there is a needed methodology for including these features in machine learning models.  Each of these gaps in current research knowledge and methodology is interesting and becoming more relevant with growing datasets.  One challenge in this interest is verifying that the detected features are actually joint data type features, and not just better learning with single data types.  

It would be interesting to apply a methodology for detecting joint data type features to existing datasets.  These datasets could be surveyed and the existence of joint data type features could be recorded.  Such a list of datasets also provides other researchers with benchmarks for testing new multi-data type features.
