\subsection{Formulate a question that specifies b.}

This section formulates a question for the research gap that can be addressed.  There are multiple research questions.

1. Can compound machine learning architectures that take text and images as inputs outperform individual models on text and images for existing machine learning benchmarks.  

2. How can interplaying features be measured between text and image data.

3. How can text and image features be preprocessed to better capture interplaying features between text and image data

4. What is the accuracy like when both features are fed into the same machine learning model?
