\subsection{Interesting Questions About the Research Gap}

The previous section explained the gap in existing methodologies for analyzing joint data type features in a dataset.  Based on the gap, an apropos question is if it is possible to detect joint data type features.  A following question is how significant these features are.  Considering that previous models ignored joint features and only learned single-type features, it makes sense that either the joint features are weaker or only occur in a limited set of the dataset. If indeed these features can be shown to exist, an interesting question is how they can be extracted from datasets.  Both validating the existance of joint data type features and extracting those features are gaps and worthwhile questions.  The next section will present research questions.  Those research questions have the goal of exploring joint data type features, both their existence and extraction.  The methodology for exploring answers to both of those questions involves a lot of existing machine learning theory.  Those theories are boosting and weak models, which will be explored in future sections.
