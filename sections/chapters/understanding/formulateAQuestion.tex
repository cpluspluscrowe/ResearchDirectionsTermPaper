\subsection{Formulate a question that specifies b.}

The previous section touched on the lack of tools for detecting joint data type features in a dataset.  Based on the gap, an apropos question is if it is possible to detect joint data type features.  If these features can be shown to exist, an interesting question is how they can be extracted from datasets.  Both validating the existance of joint data type features and extracting those features are gaps and questions this paper proposes should be answered.


%How well do autoencoders trained on both data types compare with simple architectures like NN, CNN, and RNNs that also train on both data types?
