\subsection{Formulate a question that specifies b.}

This section formulates a question for the research gap that can be addressed.  There are multiple research questions.

%%1. Can compound machine learning architectures that take text and images as inputs outperform individual models on text and images for existing machine learning benchmarks.  

1. Can compound machine learning architectures outperform find correlations between text and image data which are not captured by individual models on existing machine learning benchmarks

2. Is it possible to extract correlations between text and image data  %%How can interplaying features be measured between text and image data.

3. Is there a better way to preprocess image and text data to capture correlations between the data%%How can text and image features be preprocessed to better capture interplaying features between text and image data
a. Specifically, will transforming text and image data into LSTMs make the data easier to process by traditional machine learning models

4. How does a CNN model act when trained on both image and text data  %%What is the accuracy like when both features are fed into the same machine learning model?

5. How does a NN model act when trained on both image and text data
