\section{Research Question}


Concerning data that is composed of text and image data, there are feature interactions between data types that are measureable and in turn improve model performance?

1. Complex data types can be trained on the same simple model, such as CNN, NN, and RNNs.

2. A compound model can be constructed, which improves model performance, by training a combined model on test data that each individual models gets wrong.
