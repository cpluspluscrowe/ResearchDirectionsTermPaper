Existing machine learning models performs well on single data types.
Yet, there is little research on machine learning with multiple data types.
Existing research with multiple data types treats each data type features as independent.
This paper proposed that when modeling a single phenomenon with multiple data types, that correlations exist between the data type features. This paper proposes that some information is only captured by combining features from each data type.
Moreover, existing research acknowledges that combined models only learn single-data type features (Ngiam et al., YEAR).
This paper proposes a methodology for improving model performance with multiple data types.  Specifically, this paper proposes using boosting with combined Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to generate weak DNN models to improve performance when used in ensemble with existing single-data type models.
