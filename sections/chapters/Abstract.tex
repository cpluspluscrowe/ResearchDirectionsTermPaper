Existing machine learning models performs well on single data types.  Yet, there is little research on machine learning with multiple data types.  From the existing research on multiple data types, these treat each data type and their features as independent.  This paper proposed that each data type is not independent, i.e. when modeling a single phenomenon with multiple data types, that correlations exist between the data type features. This paper proposes that some information is only captured by combining features from each data type.  In light of existing research that acknowledges how combining data types into a model only learn single-data type features, this paper proposes a methodology for improving model performance with multiple data types.  Specifically, this paper proposes using boosting with combined Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to generate weak DNN models to improve performance when used in ensemble with existing single-data type models.
