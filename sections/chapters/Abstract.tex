Existing research has great success at machine learning on single data types.  Yet, there are few papers on modeling data consisting of multiple data types.  Most of the existing research concerns translating between data types or separately modeling each feature.  This paper theorizes that when modeling a single phenomenon with multiple data types, that some information is only captured by combining features from each data type.  The implication is that machine learning models on multiple data types can be improved by capturing relationships between each data types.  This term paper describes the theories and proposed methodologies for extracting relations between the data types in order to improve the final model.
