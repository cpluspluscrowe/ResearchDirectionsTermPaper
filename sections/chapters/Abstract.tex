\section{Abstract}

Existing research has performed well doing machine learning on single data types.
Yet, there is little research on machine learning with multiple data types. Of the
existing research on multiple data types, the approach is to treat features from
each data type as independent. This paper proposes that when modeling a single
phenomenon with multiple data types, that some information is only captured by
combining features from each data type.  Existing research into this area acknowledges that simply combining each data type is insufficient, since the model learns single data type features (Ngiam et al., YEAR).
This paper proposes a combined model with penalized learning when the combined model agrees with either individual-type model.
Penalizing for single-data type features will encourage joint feature learning.
The result is a weak model that becomes useful when used in an ensemble with each individually trained model.
