\section{Abstract}

Existing machine learning models performs well on single data types.
Yet, there is little research on machine learning with multiple data types.
Existing research with multiple data types treats each data type features as independent.
This paper proposes that data type features correlations exist in datasets modeling a single phenomenon with multiple data types,
i.e. some information is only captured by combining features from each data type.
Existing research acknowledges that combined models only learn single-data type features (Ngiam et al., YEAR).
This paper proposes using boosting with combined Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to be used in conjunction with single-data type models as an ensemble.
