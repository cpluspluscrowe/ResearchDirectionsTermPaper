\chapter{Conclusion}

Current approaches to modeling multi-type datasets tend to treat each data type as independent.  Yet, it is unlikely that each data type is independent.  Rather, it is likely that correlations exist across data types.  The trouble researchers face is detecting and extracting joint data type features.  This paper proposes that boosting based techniques can be applied to multi-data type datasets to extract joint data type features.  These methods seem promising based on the success boosting has exhibited on small datasets at model weak points.  If such a method is performant, then it provides researchers a way to detect joint data type features.  Moreover, the methodology is simple and can be implemented on benchmark datasets.
