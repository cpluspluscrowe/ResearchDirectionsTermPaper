\chapter{Conclusion}

The paper presents existing research on machine learning from datasets containins multiple data types.  Multiple open issues within IT are identified concerning machine learning from datasets containing multiple data types.  The paper then identifies possible solutions to these problems.  A few research questions are proposed and a methodology for those research questions is presented.  It is hoped that both the existing research summary, identified problems, proposed solutions and methodology will aid future researchers in exploring the arena of machine learning on datasets containing multiple data types.
