\subsection{What would you like to know?}

It would be helpful to my dissertation interests to find benchmarks and examples of for multi-data type datasets.   Benchmarks are useful for comparing model performance.  Multi-data type datasets provide further information for the research topic.  If future research or methodologies create ways to detect joint data type features, then the methodology can be applied to these examples.  

It does not seem likely that datasets like NN, CNN, or RNNs will perform better at extracting joint data type features.  Yet, how they perform is not known and so worth exploring.  It is also interesting to compare their performance to LSTM and RBMs.  Having this benchmark information might provide future research with ideas for using simple architectures for detecting joint data type features.
