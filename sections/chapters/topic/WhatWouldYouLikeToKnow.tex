\subsection{What would you like to know?}

It would be worthwhile to apply the methodology set forth in future sections to existin multi-data type benchmarks like Flickr 8k and 30k.  Benchmarks are useful for comparing model performance.  Multi-data type datasets provide further information for the research topic.  If this paper's methodology create ways to detect joint data type features, then the methodology can be applied to these benchmarks.  Part of the methodology includes an architecture for combining one type of multi-data type datasets, i.e. text and image data types.  Such benchmark testing might validate this architecture's performance.
