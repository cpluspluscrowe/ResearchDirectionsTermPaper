\subsection{What needs to be known?}

When dealing with mutliple data types, the theory that relationships exist between each data type needs proving.  Any research demonstrating that relationships exist between data types would benefit the research community.  Moreover, methods for extracting relationships between data types can improve existing machine learning models on complex data types.

% 2. theories about why they work
% 3. Methodology for drawing out related features between each data type
