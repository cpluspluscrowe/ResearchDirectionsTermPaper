\subsubsection{What needs to be known?}

Researcher's need to understand what are methods for capturing related information between text and image data.  Research will benefit from knowing if certain architectures are better at capturing correlations between image and text data, even if the final model does not perform better.  Such knowledge can be used in conjuction with other models to improve overall performance.  The field also needs to know if image and text data are related, if at all, or in which situations are the data related.
