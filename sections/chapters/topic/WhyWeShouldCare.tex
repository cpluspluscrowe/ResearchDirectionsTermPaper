\subsection{Why we should care?}

Research into better understanding joint data type datasets is worthwhile because these datsets are common and affect many persons.  The previous section listed many medical datasets containing text and image data.  Such medical datasets are important for the general population, so any improvement in understanding or processing of this data has a larger impact on society.  Improved models means improved results.  Moreover, these bette results are drawn from relationships between each data type, and so may provide a larger understanding of behavior over the entire dataset, between data types.  This larger and across data type understanding could improve how current practice makes use of medical images and symptom data together, rather than separately.  The general public should care about the research because it will provide new insights and methodologies for datasets which affect the general public.  The research can improve researcher's ability to extract knowledge out of these datasets, which will lead to greater insights and betterment of the public.
