Data is becoming larger and more complicated.  One aspect of more complicated data is data composed of multiple data types. As these examples become more common, methodologies for approaching and analyzing such data will be useful to researchers.  There are many example that contain a mix of text and image data.  Such as a patient's list of symptoms and X-Rays is an example of combined text and image data.  Image and captions is another example that has applications on social media. Each example, when improved, can benefit society and the abilities of current machine learning models.
