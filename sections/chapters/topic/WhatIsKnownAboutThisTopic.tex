\subsection{What is known about this topic?}

Little has been invested in developing models for multiple data types. Most of existing research concerns translating one data type to another and architectures for improving upon curent methods at analyzing one data type. Existing tools allow for combining machine learning models. The libraries and research gap provide opportunity to explore architectures for learning with compound datasets.
