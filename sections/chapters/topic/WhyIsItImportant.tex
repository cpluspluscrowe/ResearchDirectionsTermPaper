\subsubsection{Why is it important?}

Applied machine learning is always applying known methods to new data, on new architectures, and in new contexts.  Moreover, data is trending towards larger data sets and more diverse types of data.  The ability to better analyze a combination of text and image data will make research's approach to combined data types better.  This can improve how the field approaches more complex data types and encourage paritcular machine learning architectures or approaches to the data.
