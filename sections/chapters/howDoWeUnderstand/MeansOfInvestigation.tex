\section{Means of Investigation} % (Methodology)

The main thrust of the research question is investigative.  The questions seek to benchmark how well simple architectures handle datasets with multiple data types. The overall goal is to identify if joint data type feature correlations exist and can be measured.  The research questions then ask if existing best-performing models can be combined near the end in order to detect these joint data type features.  The final research questions build on existing joint feature research and ask how well autoencoders and LSTMs perform at detecting joint data type features when compared against their single data type counterpart.

There are many questions, but the tests are simple.
