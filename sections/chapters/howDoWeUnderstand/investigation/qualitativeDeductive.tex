\subsubsection{Quantitative/Deductive}


The means of investigation are creating models that have promise for processing both image and text data.  These models can be trained and evaluated against existing benchmark datasets.  The performance of these models validates if the general theories work.  The deductive step assumes if the proposed architectures and methods perform well on existing benchmarks, then they will perform well on other data.
