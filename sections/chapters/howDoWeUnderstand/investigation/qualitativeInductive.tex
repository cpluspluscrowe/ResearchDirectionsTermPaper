\subsubsection{Qualitative/Inductive}

The qualitative aspect of the research asks for qualitative features the new models can produce.  An example of a qualitative feature could be how including text data in a CNN might change the features picked up by a CNN from layer to layer.  Such qualitative analysis of CNN layers is common and helps researcher's understand which features each layer is targeting.

A more interesting way of performing qualitative analysis is to create auto-encoders with the new compound architectures.  The models can be trained on a combination of text and image data.  The models can then generate new images and text based on the inputs, and the results can be qualitatively examined to for general accuracy and patterns that the autoencoder learned from the data.
