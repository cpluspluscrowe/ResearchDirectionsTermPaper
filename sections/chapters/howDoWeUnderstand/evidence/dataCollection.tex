\subsubsection{Data Collection}

The paper has mentioned existing multi-data type benchmarks like Flickr 8k, 30k.  There are existing benchmarks for these datasets.  Other datasets also exist on Kaggle that include notebooks that will provide trained models and their performance.  With the provided tools, implementing the research will only require downloading the datasets and benchmark models, which are publically available.  The availability of data and research's open sourcing tools and data make this step in the research process much easier.  Outside of downloading the datasets and models, there is no other necessary data collection for the implementing the research methodology.
