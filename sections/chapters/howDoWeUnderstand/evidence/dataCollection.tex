\subsubsection{Data Collection}

Data collection is not necessary for this analysis.  Actually, it is preferred to use existing data and benchmarks for evaluating the machine learning models.  Beyond the simple analysis, there are existing datasets for advertisement data.  If the study finds performant models, these can be trained on advertising data.
