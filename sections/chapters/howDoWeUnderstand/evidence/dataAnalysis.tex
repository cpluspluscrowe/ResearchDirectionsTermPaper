\subsubsection{Data Analysis}

Data analysis for this research is standard.  The proposed models and method for preprocessing are trained on known datasets and evaluated on validation sets.  The performance of the models shows their overall performance.

The research questions concerns detecting interplay between each data type.  This type of analysis is more qualitative.  The qualitative analysis may find features which show promise for certain architectures. Such architecture findings add to the existing research.
